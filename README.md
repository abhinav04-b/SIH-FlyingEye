# Flying Eye: A Real-Time Agricultural Monitoring System

This repository implements a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python Flask for agricultural monitoring. It offers features for:

AET (Actual Evapotranspiration) Calculation: Enables farmers to precisely assess crop water requirements and optimize irrigation practices.
Live Crop Detection using Drone Imagery: Integrates with drone technology for real-time crop health assessments through image analysis.
Crop Health Measurement: Analyzes captured data to determine potential issues and suggest remedial actions.
Key Technologies:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (GSAP animation library)
Backend: Python Flask
Potential Integrations: Drone APIs (for live data acquisition)

Getting Started:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python (3.x recommended) and a code editor installed.
Clone the Repository:
Bash

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/flying-eye.git
Create a Virtual Environment (recommended):
Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
Bash

python -m venv venv
Activate the environment:
Bash

source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
Install Dependencies:
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming a requirements.txt file exists
Development Workflow:

Modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files within the static and templates directories to customize the website's appearance and functionality.
Update the Python code in app.py to handle AET calculations, drone integration (if applicable), and crop health measurement logic.
Run the Flask development server:
Bash

python app.py
This will start the server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default. You can access the website in your browser.
